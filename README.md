# Snap Safe

**Snap Safe** is a command-line tool written in Rust for creating efficient snapshots of directories.  
It is designed to help manage build artifacts, large binaries, and backups by leveraging filesystem level operations. Using hard links to avoid duplicating unchanged files.

## Features

- **Efficient Incremental Snapshots:**  
  Snap Safe uses hard links to create snapshots that only duplicate changed files, saving disk space and speeding up backup operations.

- **Simple, Lightweight Workflow:**  
  With just a few commands (`init`, `snapshot`, `list`, `diff`, `restore`), Snap Safe offers a straightforward alternative to more complex systems like Git for file-based backups.

- **Custom Metadata (Planned):**  
  Future iterations will support storing custom metadata (e.g., build version, configuration, environment details) with each snapshot, making it easier to audit and manage snapshots.

## Differentiating Snap Safe from Git

While Git is a powerful distributed version control system optimized for source code, Snap Safe is tailored for scenarios such as:

- **Target Use Case & File Types:**  
  - **Git:** Optimized for text-based source code and small-to-medium repositories.  
  - **Snap Safe:** Designed for build artifacts, large binary files, and environments where most files remain unchanged between snapshots.

- **Snapshot Methodology:**  
  - **Git:** Uses commits, branching, and delta compression, which can add overhead when dealing with large binary files.  
  - **Snap Safe:** Creates complete snapshots using hard links to avoid duplicating unchanged files, making it extremely efficient for frequent backups.

- **User Interface and Workflow:**  
  - **Git:** Offers a complex set of commands for commits, branches, merges, etc.  
  - **Snap Safe:** Provides a minimal and straightforward command set for initialization and snapshots, focused purely on state backup and restoration.

- **Performance for Large or Frequent Changes:**  
  - **Git:** Can be less optimal when handling very large files or frequent snapshots in CI/CD pipelines.  
  - **Snap Safe:** Optimized for speed and storage efficiency by linking unchanged files.

## Potential Use Cases

1. **Build Artifact Management:**  
   - **Scenario:** A large microservices project where most build outputs remain unchanged between builds.
   - **Advantage:** Snap Safe efficiently creates snapshots with minimal disk space, enabling quick rollback if a new build introduces issues.

2. **Rapid Debugging and Hotfixes:**  
   - **Scenario:** A production system requires an immediate rollback to a stable build state for debugging.
   - **Advantage:** Snap Safe can quickly restore a previous snapshot without the overhead of complex Git operations.

3. **Large Binary and Non-Code Repositories:**  
   - **Scenario:** Managing large media files, firmware, or container images that are cumbersome for Git.
   - **Advantage:** Snap Safe handles large files efficiently, providing versioned backups without relying on delta compression.

4. **Simplified Backup System:**  
   - **Scenario:** An automated backup system for a build directory that requires fast, incremental snapshots.
   - **Advantage:** Snap Safe offers an out-of-the-box solution with minimal configuration and high performance for frequent snapshots.

## üì• Installation

### From Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/snap-safe.git
cd snap-safe
cargo build --release
# The binary will be at target/release/snap_safe
```

### Using Cargo
```bash
cargo install snap_safe
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize a repository in your current directory
snap_safe init

# Create your first snapshot
snap_safe snapshot -m "Initial snapshot"

# Make some changes to files
echo "new content" > example.txt

# Create another snapshot 
snap_safe snapshot -m "Added example.txt"

# List all snapshots
snap_safe list

# Compare differences between snapshots
snap_safe diff v1.0.0.0 v1.0.0.1

# Restore a previous snapshot
snap_safe restore v1.0.0.0
```

## üß∞ Commands Reference

## üéØ Use Cases

### Build Artifact Management

Snap Safe is ideal for CI/CD pipelines where repeated builds produce mostly unchanged artifacts:

```bash
# After building your project
snap_safe snapshot -m "Build #$CI_BUILD_NUMBER" --set build_id "$CI_BUILD_NUMBER"

# To restore a previous build for testing
snap_safe restore v1.2.3.4
```

### Deployment State Management

Track the state of deployed applications with version-tagged snapshots:

```bash
# Before an upgrade
snap_safe snapshot -m "Pre-upgrade state" --add pre-upgrade

# After an upgrade
snap_safe snapshot -m "Post-upgrade state" --add post-upgrade

# If issues arise, compare the differences
snap_safe diff $(snap_safe tag --list | grep pre-upgrade | cut -d' ' -f1) $(snap_safe tag --list | grep post-upgrade | cut -d' ' -f1)
```

### Large Binary Repository Management

For repositories with large binary files that aren't suited for Git:

```bash
# Initialize in your asset directory
cd assets/
snap_safe init

# After adding new assets
snap_safe snapshot -m "Added new character models"

# When you need to revert to a previous state
snap_safe restore v1.0.0.3
```

### Configuration Management

Track changes to configuration across environments:

```bash
# Store a snapshot of configuration
snap_safe snapshot -m "Production config" --add production
snap_safe snapshot -m "Staging config" --add staging

# View what's different between environments
snap_safe text-diff production staging
```

## üîß How It Works

Snap Safe creates efficient snapshots through a combination of techniques:

1. **Hard Links for Efficiency**:  
   Instead of duplicating unchanged files, Snap Safe creates hard links pointing to the same data blocks on disk, drastically reducing storage requirements.

2. **Snapshot Manifests**:  
   Each snapshot includes a detailed manifest tracking file metadata (paths, sizes, modification times).

3. **Metadata Tracking**:  
   Custom metadata and tags allow you to organize snapshots by version, environment, or any other criteria.

4. **Specialized Diffing**:  
   Between snapshots, Snap Safe can identify what files were added, removed, or modified.
